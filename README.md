face-classifier-trainer
=======================

College project on classifying facial expressions using neural networks and opencv.

I used this to train and test neural networks for classifiying facial expressions


Program uses a GTK+ UI , Runs on Ubuntu, can't garuntee it runs on anything else.
The program should allow you to train neural networks from folders of images and 
allow you to test them with a webcamera.


I haven't included the images used to train the NN as i dont own them, and pushing GB's of images
onto Github would be bad idea.


Few warnings:

Naming conventions and model view controller were alien concepts to me when i made this.

I was awake often a few days in a row while working on this.

There is no memory management so on laptop running Ubuntu with 2gb ram you have about 20 minutes before
your computer grinds to a halt.
